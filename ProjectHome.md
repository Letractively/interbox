[DigitalBox](https://code.google.com/p/digitalbox) is defined as a CMS and is a learning process for me to create a web system. However, a CMS has too many limitations to cater to different requirements, but it does help build up a typical conceptual model for any web systems and that is InterBox. Moreover, I consider it to be a web platform that is capable to hold various types of web applications. And therefore, InterBox is MUCH MORE than a conceptual model or a framework. It is a WEB PLATFORM! (Currently, it is being developed and only a few classes are available here and I think it is an accumulative process.)
